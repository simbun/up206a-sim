# up206a-sim
## Introduction
Please call me Sim. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I grew up in San Jose, specifically the East Side. I went to Davis for undergrad, and I majored in Community and Regional Development and minored in African and African American Studies. After graduating, I was lost and did not know what to do with myself so I applied for an AmeriCorp VISTA position all the way in Buffalo, NY. I spent a year there doing small business development work at a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI). I enjoyed working with minority and women small business owners. After Buffalo, I moved back to San Jose where I did Zoom school for a year-so that makes me a second year. Now, I live in Koreatown, LA. Finding an *affordable* apartment in LA was rough. On that note, I am passionate about affordable housing development and small business development; which is why my AOC is CEDH.
## Description of the course per [UP206A:Intro to GIS and Spatial Data Science](https://github.com/yohman/22W-UP206A#up206a-introduction-to-gis-and-spatial-data-science)
In summary, this is an intro to GIS course where we will learn the basics of coding and geographic information system (GIS), starting with an introduction to foundational concepts and tools such as Python. Then later moving on to more advanced lessons on geoprocessing and spatial analytical methods. We will use "real" data as this will serve as practice for addressing the relevant problems. 
The learning objective for the course centers around students being able to "critically evaluate data and create frameworks [and visuals such as tables, charts, and maps] to prepare data for research". 
### Assignments
There will be **7 to 10** individual assignments, **4** group assignments, **1** mid-term (report & presentation), and **1** final (report & presentation).
## Project ideas
- Map of financial insitutions such as banks and bank-owned atms
- Map of CRA bank ratings in area and prevalence of check-cashing stores
- Map of big development projects in LA and rent trends 
- Map of income levels and nonprofit organizations
## Objective for the class
My objectives are to learn the basics of coding and become better at geoprocessing and spatial analysis! By the end of this class I want to be able to create a map that tells a succinct story. I would like to become somewhat proficient in Python.
