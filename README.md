# up206a-sim
## Introduction
Please call me Sim. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a second-year MURP and my AOC is CEDH.
## Description of the course per [UP206A:Intro to GIS and Spatial Data Science](https://github.com/yohman/22W-UP206A#up206a-introduction-to-gis-and-spatial-data-science)
In summary, this is an intro to GIS course where we will learn the basics of coding and geographic information system (GIS), starting with an introduction to foundational concepts and tools such as Python. Then later moving on to more advanced lessons on geoprocessing and spatial analytical methods. We will use "real" data as this will serve as practice for addressing the relevant problems. 
The learning objective for the course centers around students being able to "critically evaluate data and create frameworks[and visuals such as tables, charts, and maps]to prepare data for research". 
### Assignments
There will be **7 to 10** individual assignments, **4** group assignments, **1** mid-term (report & presentation), and **1** final (report & presentation).
## Project ideas
I am not sure what kind of project I am want to work on yet. I think I may be interested in mapping financial insitutions such as banks, check-cashing stores, CDFIs, and credit unions in low-income areas.
## Objective for the class
My objectives are to learn the basics of coding and become better at geoprocessing and spatial analytical methods! By the end of this class I want to be able to create a map that tells a succinct story.
