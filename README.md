## Introduction
Please call me Sim. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a second-year MURP and my AOC is CEDH.
## Description of the course per [UP206A:Intro to GIS](https://github.com/yohman/22W-UP206A#up206a-introduction-to-gis-and-spatial-data-science)
In summary, this is an intro to GIS course where we will learn the basics of coding and geographic information system (GIS), starting with an introduction to foundational concepts and tools such as Python. Then later moving on to more advanced lessons on geoprocessing and spatial analytical methods. We will use "real" data as this will serve as practice for addressing the relevant problems that exists. 
The learning objective for the course centers around students being able to "critically evaluate data and create frameworks[and visuals such as tables, charts, and maps]to prepare data for research". 
### Assignments
There will be **7 to 10** individual assignments, **4** group assignments, **1** mid-term (report & presentation), and **1** final (report & presentation).
